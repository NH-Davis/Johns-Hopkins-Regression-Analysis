**SUMMARY**
:::

The mtcars dataset originates from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and it comprises fuel consumption (mpg, or miles per gallon) and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models). The dataset includes a dozen categories of information and is often used in statistical analysis and machine learning to demonstrate data exploration, visualization, and regression techniques. It's popular for its simplicity yet effectiveness in teaching various concepts related to data science and statistics.

**CONCLUSION**

::: 

The results of the analysis indicate that there is a statistically significant difference in fuel economy (MPG) between vehicles which have automatic and manual transmissions. Average MPG is noticeably higher for manual transmissions and the range of potential outcomes is also better with the bottom of the interquartile range for manual transmissions exceeding the top of the interquartile range for automatic transmissions. The average MPG for manual transmission vehicles is 24.4 MPG while the average MPG for automatic transmission vehicles was substantially lower at 17.1 MPG, leaving a gap of approximately 7.3 MPG between the two groups.
